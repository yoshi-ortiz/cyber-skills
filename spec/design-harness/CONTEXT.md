# Design Harness Context

This project uses an evidence-backed, iterative design harness.

The inspiration source is configured in `spec/design-harness/project.json`; its directory name is not part of the contract. It is user-owned, read-only evidence. All derived material belongs outside that source root.

Read in order:

1. `spec/design-harness/DECISIONS.md` — **read this before proposing anything.** It lists the design elements already in standing and their star ranks. They are inputs to your work, not open questions.
2. `spec/design-harness/CONTRACTS.md`
3. `spec/design-harness/WORKFLOWS.md`
4. `spec/design-harness/capability-matrix.json`
5. `spec/design-harness/source-manifest.json`
6. `spec/design-harness/QUESTIONNAIRE.md`

Repository files and validated evidence are authoritative. Model memory is not evidence, and neither is conversation history: if a decision is not in `DECISIONS.md` it does not bind — and if it is, you may not drop it without recording a supersede first.

## Resuming work

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/bootstrap_harness.py validate --project-root .
```

Green means the corpus is unchanged and the ledger is coherent. Then read `DECISIONS.md`, name the design elements your iteration touches, and leave every other element alone.

Record what the user tells you as you go, never at the end:

```bash
# a decision stated in conversation
bootstrap_harness.py decide --project-root . \
  --element cover.layout.two-column --verdict approved --stars 5 \
  --evidence "user: 'c2'"

# star ranks the user set in the companion
bootstrap_harness.py adopt --project-root . \
  --companion-ledger .superpowers/brainstorm/decisions.jsonl
```
